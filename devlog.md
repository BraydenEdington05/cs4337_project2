        - Installed VSCode and prolog plugin
        - Installed swipl and added it to my computer's path 
        So far, the setup to run prolog was rough on my Windows PC.
        I originally had Aqua IDE and found that IDE did not support
        prolog. I researched what was the best IDE for prolog and found
        VSCode. I downloaded and install VSCode and a prolog plugin. 
        Getting VSCode to recognize swipl was also challenging. I ended
        up having to add the swipl.exe file to my windows path, restarted
        VSCode and then it finally recognized it.

        - Created Hello World project to get down to run prolog. 
          Found to run the project in VSCode
          I needed to run these steps: 
               type: swipl in the terminal
               type: ['<filename.pl>'].  
                   (where <filename.pl> was replaced with the prolog filename)
               type: hello .  (This is the method name that should be called)
               Ctrl D to exit
