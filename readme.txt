About:
This project takes an input maze and solves the maze while following directions.It is coded entirely in prolog and requires an input file to be functional 

My Experience Creating It:
The first thing I had to do was install VS code so I could code the project. Then I had to make a git destination for this project. When 
creating the project the first thing I did was make the find exit and find start tiles for the code. I thought it would be easiest to get it out of the way.
After that I created the movement system so that if I wanted to go left,right,up, and down so I could make that happen. After that I made the recursive function to find the 
correct pathing to the exit and finally I added extra functions like validating the map and validating the tile allong with creating the recursive function.
